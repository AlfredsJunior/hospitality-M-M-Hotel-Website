        <p>The M&M Hotel is located in the blissful village of Burt,</p>
        <p> Inishowen, Njoro. Only 10 - 15 minutes from Nakuru town, </p>
        <p>Letterkenny and Buncrana.  A real 'gem in Irish Hospitality'.</p>
          <p>The Hotel itself gains its inspiration from the ancient Kenyan </p>
          <p>of Ailigh Fort which stands proud on the hill shadowing the Hotel.
          <p> It opened its doors for business in December 2006 and has grown </p>
          <p>from strength to strength and has been regarded by many as one of</p>
          <p> the finest Hotels in the North West.  </p>
